## ABOUT
This plugin helps you create bezier splines either visually in editor or by code during gameplay. Includes some utility functions like finding the closest point on the spline or travelling the spline with constant speed.

## HOW TO
To create a new spline in the editor, follow "GameObject - Bezier Spline". Now you can select the end points of the spline in the Scene view and translate/rotate/scale or delete/duplicate them as you wish (each end point has 2 control points, which can also be translated). Here are some of the interesting properties of a spline:

- Loop: connects the first end point and the last end point of the spline
- Draw Runtime Gizmos: draws the spline during gameplay
- Handle Mode: control points of end points are handled in one of 3 ways: Free mode allows moving control points independently, Mirrored mode places the control points opposite to each other and Aligned mode ensures that both control points are aligned on a line that passes through the end point (unlike Mirrored mode, their distance to end point may differ)
- Construct Linear Path: constructs a completely linear path between the end points by using Free handle mode and adjusting the control points of end points
- Auto Construct Spline: auto adjusts the control points of end points to form a smooth spline that goes through the end points you set. There are 2 different implementations for it, with each giving a slightly different output

Framework comes with 4 additional components that may help you move objects or particles along splines. These components are located in the Utilities folder:

- BezierWalkerWithSpeed: Moves an object along a spline with constant speed. There are 3 travel modes: Once, Ping Pong and Loop. If Look At is Forward, the object will always face forwards. If it is SplineExtraData, the extra data stored in the spline's end points is used to determine the rotation. You can modify this extra data from the points' Inspector. The smoothness of the rotation can be adjusted via Rotation Lerp Modifier. Normalized T determines the starting point. Each time the object completes a lap, its On Path Completed () event is invoked. To see this component in action without entering Play mode, click the "Simulate In Editor" button.
- BezierWalkerWithTime: Travels a spline in Travel Time seconds. Movement Lerp Modifier parameter defines the smoothness applied to the position of the object.
- BezierWalkerLocomotion: Allows you to move a number of objects together with this object on a spline. This component must be attached to an object with a BezierWalker component (tail objects don't need a BezierWalker, though). Look At, Movement Lerp Modifier and Rotation Lerp Modifier parameters affect the tail objects.
- ParticlesFollowBezier: Moves particles of a Particle System in the direction of a spline. It is recommended to set the Simulation Space of the Particle System to World for increased performance. This component affects particles in one of two ways:
-- Strict: particles will strictly follow the spline. They will always be aligned to the spline and will reach the end of the spline at the end of their lifetime. This mode performs slightly better than Relaxed mode
-- Relaxed: properties of the particle system like speed, Noise and Shape will affect the movement of the particles. Particles in this mode will usually look more interesting. If you want the particles to stick with the spline, though, set their speed to 0
